# Test Benches

Test benches are used to simulate modules. They are especially useful in letting someone work on Verilog code without needing the hardware or having to generate a bitstream everytime there is a small change.

## Implementation
Test benches are implemented using a module with no ports. 

Within the test bench module is where the module to simulate will be instantiated. 

Because test bench modules don't have ports, you need to create your own. For each `input` and `inout` port that connects to the module to simulate, there needs to be a reg declared. Each `output` port that connects to the module to simulate should be declare as a wire.

Here is a small example:
>```verilog
>module and_2bit(
>   input a, b,
>   output c
>);
>    assign c = a & b;
>endmodule
>
>module myTestBench();
>   reg a, b;
>   wire c;
>   
>   and_2bit U0(.a(a), .b(b), .c(c));
>   
>endmodule
>```

## Simulating
Along with creating to ports inside the test bench module, you need to create the logic for the test bench. Since the inputs to the module to simulate are type reg and need to be changed multiple times, they should be set in a procedural statement. Usually this is done in an `initial` statement and ends with a `$finish` statement. 

We also want to have delays so we can see what is going on in a timing diagram. This is done by using a pound (`#`) sign followed by the number of time-units to delay. For example, if we wanted to have a 5 time-unit delay before setting `reg a` high, we would write `#5 a = 1'b1;` in the procedural statement.

Usng the previous example, here is a modified version that shows it with simulation logic:
>```verilog
>module and_2bit(
>   input a, b,
>   output c
>);
>    assign c = a & b;
>endmodule
>
>module myTestBench();
>   reg a, b;
>   wire c;
>   
>   and_2bit U0(.a(a), .b(b), .c(c));
>   
>   initial
>   begin
>       a = 1'b0;
>       b = 1'b0;
>       #5
>       a = 1'b1;
>       b = 1'b0;
>       #5
>       a = 1'b0;
>       b = 1'b1;
>       #5
>       a = 1'b1;
>       b = 1'b1;
>       #5 $finish;
>   end 
>endmodule
>```

This example changes the values of `a` and `b`every 5 time units. Output `c` can be seen in the timing diagram after the simulation is run. It can also be seen by using `$display` to print out the values to the console.

## Example
Supose you need to test the following module:
```verilog
module registers #(
    parameter WIDTH=8,
    parameter DEPTH=8
  ) (
      input clk, write_en, read_en, reset,
      input [(DEPTH-1):0] addr,
      input [(WIDTH-1):0] data_in,
      output [(WIDTH-1):0] data_out
);

  reg [(WIDTH-1):0] memory [0:(DEPTH-1)];
  reg [(WIDTH-1):0] read_data;
  
  always@(posedge clk)
  begin
    if(reset)
    begin
      // Reset all of memory
    end
    else if(write_en)
    begin
      memory[addr] <= data_in;
    end
    else if(read_en)
    begin
      read_data <= memory[addr];
    end
    else
    end
      read_data <= read_data; // Don't do anything
    begin
  end

  assign data_out = read_data;

endmodule  
```

We could then create a test bench like so:
```verilog
// The following sets each time-unit to 1 
// nano-second with a 1 pico-second resolution
`timescale 1ns/1ps 

module registers_testbench(); // Remember, no ports are used in a testbench

  // Inputs (If the signal is an input or inout to the 
  // module we are simulating, it must be of type reg)
  reg clk, reset, write_en, read_en;
  reg [7:0] data_in;
  reg [2:0] address; // This is 3 bits since that will give us the numbers 0-7 (8 possible addresses)
  
  // Outputs (If the signal is an output from the 
  // module we are simulating, it must be of type wire)
  wire [7:0] data_out;
  
  // Integers (Used for loops)
  integer i;
  
  // Instantiate the module we want to simulate. 
  // There should only be one. If we want to 
  // simulate another module, we would want to 
  // make another simulation file with a different 
  // module separate from this one.
  registers U0 #(
    .WIDTH(8),
    .DEPTH(8)
  ) (
    .clk(clk),
    .reset(reset),
    .write_en(write_en),
    .read_en(read_en),
    .addr(address),
    .data_in(data_in),
    .data_out(data_out)
  );

  // initial statements are only executed during 
  // simulations (they aren't synthesizable)
  initial
  begin
    // Set initial values
    clk = 1'b0;
    write_en = 1'b0;
    read_en = 1'b0;
    address = 3'b000;
    
    // Start with asserting a reset so that 
    // everything within the module being
    // simulated also gets initialized.
    reset = 1'b1; 
    
    $display("Starting Test Bench\n");
    
    // Since the clock is being pulsed by the always 
    // statement at the bottom of the module, we can 
    // use delays to make sure the values change after
    // a clock pulse. In this case, it would be a delay
    // of 10 time-units
    
    // Here we give some time for the clock to pulse
    // before de-asserting reset.
    #10 reset = 1'b0;
    $display("Finished asserting reset.\n");
    #10 // Delay for another small bit.
    
    // Now we can start setting values and testing.
    
    // First, we will start by seeing if all addresses 
    // were set to zero during the reset.

    read_en = 1'b1; // State that we are going to read
    for(i = 0; i < 8; i = i + 1)
    begin
      address = i;
      #10 // Delay for a clock cylce to give time to read
      if(data_out != 8'h00)
      begin
        $display("\tERROR: Unable to reset address %d!\n", address);
      end
    end

    begin
      // We wiil write a different value for each address,
      // starting with 1, so that we can see if we are

    end
    
    // Next we will read from all of the addresses.
