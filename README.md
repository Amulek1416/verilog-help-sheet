# Verilog Help Sheet
This is a help sheet for programming in Verilog/System Verilog. This will help you to understand different aspects of Verilog. This assumes that the information is being read in the order of the **Contents** section. Click on the link of the topic to learn more about the topic.

**Warning:** Most of the code that exists will be shown using primarily Verilog. There will be a help to show the main differences between the two in the future. However, most of the code should work in both Verilog and System Verilog with minimal changes needed.
