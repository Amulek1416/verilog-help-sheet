# Verilog Help Sheet
This is a help sheet for programming in Verilog/System Verilog. This will help you to understand different aspects of Verilog. This assumes that the information is being read in the order of the **Contents** section. Click on the link of the topic to learn more about the topic.

**Warning:** Most of the code that exists will be shown using primarily Verilog. There will be a help to show the main differences between the two in the future. However, most of the code should work in both Verilog and System Verilog with minimal changes needed. If there is a significant difference berween System Verilog and Verilog, then there will be information about that difference in the applicable section.
